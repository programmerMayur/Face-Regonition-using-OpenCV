# Face-Regonition-using-OpenCV
You need first python 3.6 bcz i face issue in install dlib library in python 3.8, that why i used python 3.6.
So create virtual environment then install all libraries that mension in requirment.txt folder and simply run the attendence.py.
try.py is only used for testing you dont worry about it.
It take 2 img as input and check the accuracy how much they matched.
